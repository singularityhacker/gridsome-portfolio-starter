<p>SOS Animal Rescue is a non-profit organization. We are run solely by a handful of volunteers with other full-time jobs, and depend heavily on donations and fundraisers to fulfill our mission to reduce the unwanted pet population. We are a foster home-based rescue, and do not own a building or a shelter. We provide all necessary vetting, vaccinations, and spay/neuter surgeries. The typical cost of caring for one kitten from intake until adoption is about $125 for vet bills alone – not including  food and litter.</p><br>

<p>We thank you for your support, and accept monetary donations, supplies, gift cards, and volunteers. Receipts for donations can be relayed upon request. Please contact us and check out our events page to assist us at upcoming events and fundraisers.</p><br>
