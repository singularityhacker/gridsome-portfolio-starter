<h3 class="text-2xl">Adoption Policies</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that our pets go to loving fur-ever homes, SOS Animal Rescue has the following adoption policies in place. These policies are subject to change or vary on a case-by-case basis. We usually do not do same-day adoptions. There may be some exceptions (such as, if you have adopted from us in the past and your info is on file). There is an application process to adopt.</p><br>

<ul class="text-lg sm:text-xl">
  <li class="mb-4">
    <div class="text-lg text-gray-600">If other animals are in the home, a vet reference check will be done. If you rent your home, a landlord pet agreement form will be required.</div>
  </li>
  <li class="mb-4">
    <div class="text-lg text-gray-600">Our adoption fee is $125 for kittens under one year or $100 for cats over one year old. Our adoption fee for two cats or kittens is $200. The adoption fee includes all age-appropriate vaccinations and their spay/neuter.</div>
  </li>
  <li class="mb-4">
    <div class="text-lg text-gray-600">The adopter agrees that cats must be kept indoors only.</div>
  </li>
  <li class="mb-4">
    <div class="text-lg text-gray-600">Adopter must sign a contract NOT to declaw. Declawing is a painful and permanently scarring procedure that can cause behavioral and health problems in cats.</div>
  </li>
  <li class="mb-4">
    <div class="text-lg text-gray-600">SOS reserves the right to refuse adoption to any person we feel is not in the best interest of the kitten or cat.</div>
